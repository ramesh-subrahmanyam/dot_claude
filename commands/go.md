description: Load code base structure and general practices and rules to follow for this project
---

** Understand codebase** Read the docs/codebase_structure.md file in the project root directory to understand the project architecture, key components, and design patterns. Provide a brief summary of what you learned.

If the documentation file doesn't exist, explore the codebase to understand its structure using the "document/" command

** Throwaway code** All throwaway programs you create should be created in a directiry called temp/

** Testing ** Any long-use test programs should be created in the test/ directory.  But all throwaway testing code should be written to  temp/

** Throwaway test code ** When you are asked to create or modify new functionality, first create a test plan, write testing code in the temp directory, implement the functionality and make sure the test code passes the tests.

** Updating documentation if needed ** If your code addditions/modifications require modifying  docs/codebase_structure.md, do so

**Document files** All documentation should be created in the docs directory of the project


Simply say "Instructions understood" in response to the present command.  No verbose response to these instructins needed.
